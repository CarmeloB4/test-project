## Design reference üé®
This is the draft on which the layout and flow of this project is based: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iS8EY0ZxQqCz15J5Jjy2Ju/Prototype---Project?node-id=0%3A1)

## Libraries used üìó
We used the classic [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library for design and the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) library to use some components

## Deploy ‚ú®
I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for the deployment, unfortunately I was unable to set the environment variables. This is the link: https://test-project-f30hdcumg-carmelob4.vercel.app/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
